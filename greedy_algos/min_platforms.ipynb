    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given arrival and departure times of trains on a single day in a railway platform, **find out the minimum number of platforms required** so that no train has to wait for the other(s) to leave. *In other words, when a train is about to arrive, at least one platform must be available to accommodate it.* \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given arrival and departure times both in the form of a list. The size of both the lists will be equal, with each common index representing the same train. Note: Time `hh:mm` would be written as integer `hhmm` for e.g. `9:30` would be written as `930`. Similarly, `13:45` would be given as `1345`\n",

    "Sort the schedule, and make sure when a train arrives or depart, keep track of the required number of platforms. We will have iterator `i` and `j` traversing the arrival and departure lists respectively. At any moment, the difference `(i - j)` will provide us the required number of platforms. \n",
    "    \n",
    "At the time of either arrival or departure of a train, if `i^th` arrival is scheduled before the `j^th` departure, increment the `platform_required` and `i` as well. Otherwise, decrement `platform_required` count, and increase `j`. Keep track of the **max** value of `platform_required` ever, as the expected result. \n",
